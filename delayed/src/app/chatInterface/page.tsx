          <p>
            You and your conversational partner, ChatGPT, will engage in an activity where you create a drama script based on a given scenario.
            This worksheet has information for your conversation. Each piece of information is numbered. Follow the numbers when you talk with ChatGPT.
            Each piece of information includes English words. You have to include them in your sentences.
            Make sure to carefully read what ChatGPT says during the conversation.
            Organize your drama script coherently and add more information if needed.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Scenario</h2>
          <p>
            This scenario features two characters (Yusuf and Omar). ChatGPT will write lines for Yusuf, and you will write lines for Omar.
            Yusuf and Omar are students at the same university and are close friends. They are having a conversation about the exchange program.
            Their university has exchange programs such as ERASMUS, Mevlana, and Free Mover.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are ready, type "ready" in the chat box to start the conversation.
            Try to create longer sentences than just a phrase or words. (Do not say just “Ok”, “Good”, etc.)
            When you are done, type “the end” to finish the task.
